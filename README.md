# Object-Detection-Using-SSD-MobileNet

This Repo contains implemtation of Mobilenet-SSD300 and Deployment it on PC as well as Android.

## Overview 
In this repo you will find the implementation of SSD300 with mobilenet in tensorflow. I used tensorflow model zoo weights trained on coco object detection dataset and deploy that model using opencv and their is an additional feature i.e Driver Alert in which whenever any car,Bus or Truck comes closed to 5 meters it will give warning to driver.

I deployed it on PC using opencv and furthur I deployed it on Android using tflite.

More Information about this project is available in [this](https://medium.com/@kamleshsolanki1108/object-detection-using-ssd-mobilenet-with-tensorflow-1ee6e45a378b) article.

## Navigation 

In Object Detection folder you will be able to find implementation and deployment of model in PC using Opencv.

In Object Detection App you will be able to find implementation in android.
